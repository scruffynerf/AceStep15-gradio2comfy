# API Keys Directory

This directory is used to store sensitive API keys and tokens for ACE-Step nodes.

## Genius API Token
1. Get a personal access token from [Genius API Clients](https://genius.com/api-clients).
2. Create a file named `genius_api_key.txt` in this directory.
3. Paste your token into that file as a single line.

**Note**: This directory is git-ignored and *.txt files should never be committed to version control.
